# From Chris Moesel:  you should not rely on SUSHI to create a snapshot.
# This is why I recommended in my earlier comment that if you put the built SD into input/resources, use the
# SD created by the IG Publisher (not directly from SUSHI). In other words, this should work fine for creating
# and using custom resources:
#
# 1. Use FSH Instance syntax to create an instance of StructureDefinition with differential elements specified.
# 2. Build w/ SUSHI to produce formal SD in fsh-generated, but it will still have no snapshot elements.
# 3. Use IG Publisher to build the IG, which will create a new SD in output w/ the snapshot elements.
# 4. Copy the SD from output to input/resources so that SUSHI will pick it up as a FHIR definition next time.
# 5. Comment out the original FSH definition (from step 1) so SUSHI doesn't generate it again.
# 6. Now you can use that custom resource as an InstanceOf or Parent in other FSH definitions.
#
# Of course you can use another tool (like Forge) to create the custom resource, but if you prefer to use FSH
# and don't mind the sequence up above, it should work. Of course, you'll need to redo that every time you need
# to make edits to the custom resource.
